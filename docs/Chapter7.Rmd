In this chapter we discuss regression models. The basic concept is that we forecast the time series of interest $y$ assuming that it has a linear relationship with other time series $x$.

**Forecast variable $y$**:  aka regressand, dependent or explained variable. 

**Predictor variables $x$** aka regressors, independent or explanatory variables.

# 7.1 The linear model

## Simple linear regression

$$y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_t + \varepsilon_t$$

$\beta_0$: $y$-intercept, represents the predicted value of $y$ when $x=0$

$\beta_1$: slope, represents the average predicted change in $y$ resulting from a one unit increase in $x$.

<img src="https://otexts.com/fpp3/fpp_files/figure-html/SLRpop1-1.png" />

We can think of each observation $y_t$ as consisting of the systematic or explained part of the model, $\beta_0+\beta_1x_t$ and the random “error” $\epsilon_t$. The “error” term does not imply a mistake, but a deviation from the underlying straight line model. **$\epsilon_t$ captures anything that may affect $y_t$ other than $x_t$.**

## Example: US consumption of expenditure

```{r}
us_change
```

```{r}
us_change |>
  pivot_longer(c(Consumption, Income), names_to = "Series") |>
  autoplot(value) +
  labs(y = "% change")
```
This shows time series of quarterly percentage changes (growth rates) of real personal consumption expenditure, $y$, and real personal disposable income, $x$, for the US from 1970 Q1 to 2019 Q2.

```{r}
us_change |>
  ggplot(aes(x = Income, y = Consumption)) +
  labs(y = "Consumption (quarterly % change)",
       x = "Income (quarterly % change)") +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```


This is a scatter plot of consumption changes against income changes along with the estimated regression line

$$\hat{y}_t=0.54 + 0.27x_t.$$

$\hat{y}$: value of $y$ predicted by the model.

The equation is estimated using the `TSLM()` function and shown with **`report()`**

```{r}
us_change |>
  model(TSLM(Consumption ~ Income)) |>
  report()
```

The fitted line has a positive slope, reflecting the positive relationship between income and consumption. The slope coefficient shows that a one unit increase in $x$ (a 1% increase in personal disposable income) results on average in 0.27 units increase in $y$ (an average increase of 0.27% in personal consumption expenditure). Alternatively the estimated equation shows that a value of 1 for $x$ (the percentage increase in personal disposable income) will result in a forecast value of $0.54+0.27×1=0.82$ for $y$ (the percentage increase in personal consumption expenditure).

**The interpretation of the intercept requires that a value of $x=0$
makes sense.** In this case when $x=0$ (i.e., when there is no change in personal disposable income since the last quarter) the predicted value of $y$ is 0.54 (i.e., an average increase in personal consumption expenditure of 0.54%). Even when $x=0$ does not make sense, the intercept is an important part of the model. Without it, the slope coefficient can be distorted unnecessarily. The intercept should always be included unless the requirement is to force the regression line “through the origin”. In what follows we assume that an intercept is always included in the model.

## Multiple linear regression

$$
\begin{equation}
  y_t = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} x_{1,t} + \beta_{2} x_{2,t} + \cdots + \beta_{k} x_{k,t} + \varepsilon_t,
  \tag{7.1}
\end{equation}
$$

where $y$ is the variable to be forecast and $x_1,\dots,x_k$ are the $k$
predictor variables. Each of the predictor variables must be numerical. The coefficients $\beta_1, \dots, \beta_k$ measure the effect of each predictor after taking into account the effects of all the other predictors in the model. Thus, **the coefficients measure the marginal effects of the predictor variables**.

## Example: US consumption expenditure

```{r}
us_change |>
  select(-Consumption, -Income) |>
  pivot_longer(-Quarter) |>
  ggplot(aes(Quarter, value, colour = name)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(name ~ ., scales = "free_y") +
  guides(colour = "none") +
  labs(y="% change")
```


These are quarterly percentage changes in industrial production and personal savings, and quarterly changes in the unemployment rate (as this is already a percentage). Building a multiple linear regression model can potentially generate more accurate forecasts as we expect consumption expenditure to not only depend on personal income but on other predictors as well.

```{r message=FALSE}
us_change |>
  GGally::ggpairs(columns = 2:6)
```

This is a scatterplot matrix of five variables. The first column shows the relationships between the forecast variable (consumption) and each of the predictors. The scatterplots show positive relationships with income and industrial production, and negative relationships with savings and unemployment. The strength of these relationships are shown by the correlation coefficients across the first row. The remaining scatterplots and correlation coefficients show the relationships between the predictors.

## Assumptions

1. The model is a reasonable approximation to reality; that is, the relationship between the forecast variable and the predictor variables satisfies this linear equation.

2. We make the following assumptions about the errors ${\epsilon_1,\dots,\epsilon_T}$
  - they have mean zero; otherwise the forecasts will be systematically biased.
  - they are not autocorrelated; otherwise the forecasts will be inefficient, as there is more information in the data that can be exploited.
  - they are unrelated to the predictor variables; otherwise there would be more information that should be included in the systematic part of the model.
  
It is also useful to have the errors being normally distributed with a constant variance $\sigma^2$ in order to easily produce prediction intervals.

Another important assumption in the linear regression model is that each predictor $x$ is not a random variable. If we were performing a controlled experiment in a laboratory, we could control the values of each $x$ (so they would not be random) and observe the resulting values of $y$. With observational data (including most data in business and economics), it is not possible to control the value of $x$, we simply observe it. Hence we make this an assumption.

# 7.2 Least squares estimation

In practice, of course, we have a collection of observations but we do not know the values of the coefficients $\beta_0, \beta_1, \dots, \beta_k$ . These need to be estimated from the data.

The least squares principle provides a way of choosing the coefficients effectively by minimising the sum of the squared errors. That is, we choose the values of $\beta_0, \beta_1, \dots, \beta_k$ that minimise

$$
\sum_{t=1}^T \varepsilon_t^2 = \sum_{t=1}^T (y_t -
  \beta_{0} - \beta_{1} x_{1,t} - \beta_{2} x_{2,t} - \cdots - \beta_{k} x_{k,t})^2.
$$

This is called **least squares estimation** because it gives the least value for the sum of squared errors. **Finding the best estimates of the coefficients is often called “fitting” the model to the data**, or sometimes “learning” or “training” the model. The line shown above was obtained in this way.

$\hat{\beta}_0, \hat{\beta}_1, \dots, \hat{\beta}_k$ are the **estimated coefficients**. 

`TSLM()` fits a linear regression model to time series data. It is similar to `lm()` which is widely used for linear models, but `TSLM()` provides additional facilities for handling time series.

## Example: US consumption expenditures

A multiple linear regression model for US consumption is

$$
y_t=\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1,t}+ \beta_2 x_{2,t}+ \beta_3 x_{3,t}+ \beta_4 x_{4,t}+\varepsilon_t,
$$

- $y$:  % change in real personal consumption expenditure
- $x_11 % change in real personal disposable income
- $x_2$ % change in industrial production
- $x_3$ % change in personal savings and
- $x_4$ change in the unemployment rate.

The following output provides information about the fitted model. The first column of Coefficients gives an estimate of each $\beta$ coefficient and the second column gives its standard error (i.e., the standard deviation which would be obtained from repeatedly estimating the $\beta$ coefficients on similar data sets). The standard error gives a measure of the uncertainty in the estimated $\beta$ coefficient.

```{r}
fit_consMR <- us_change |>
  model(tslm = TSLM(Consumption ~ Income + Production + Unemployment + Savings))
report(fit_consMR)
```

The “t value” is the ratio of an estimated $\beta$ coefficient to its standard error and the last column gives the p-value: the probability of the estimated $\beta$ coefficient being as large as it is if there was no real relationship between consumption and the corresponding predictor. This is useful when studying the effect of each predictor, but is not particularly useful for forecasting.

## Fitted values

Predictions of $y$ can be obtained by using the estimated coefficients in the regression equation and setting the error term to zero. In general we write,

$$
\begin{equation}
  \hat{y}_t = \hat\beta_{0} + \hat\beta_{1} x_{1,t} + \hat\beta_{2} x_{2,t} + \cdots + \hat\beta_{k} x_{k,t}.
  \tag{7.2}
\end{equation}
$$

Plugging in the values of $x_{1,t},\dots,x_{k,t}$ for $t=1,\dots,T$ returns predictions of $y_t$ within the training set, referred to as fitted values. Note that **these are predictions of the data used to estimate the model, not genuine forecasts of future values of $y$**.
 .
The following plots show the actual values compared to the fitted values for the percentage change in the US consumption expenditure series. The time plot shows that the fitted values follow the actual data fairly closely. This is verified by the strong positive relationship shown by the scatterplot

.
```{r}
augment(fit_consMR) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = Quarter)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = Consumption, colour = "Date")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = .fitted, colour = "Fitted")) +
  labs(y = NULL,
       title = "Percent change in US consumption expenditure") +
  scale_colour_manual(values = c(Data = "black", Fitted = "#D55E00")) +
  guides(colour = guide_legend(title = NULL))
```

```{r}
augment(fit_consMR) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = Consumption, y = .fitted)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    y = "Fitted (predicted values)",
    x = "Data (actual values)",
    title = "Percent change in US consumption expenditure"
  ) +
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1)
```

## Goodness-of-fit

A common way to summarise how well a linear regression model fits the data is via the **coefficient of determination**, or $R^2$. This can be calculated as the square of the correlation between the observed $y$ values and the predicted $\hat{y}$ values. Alternatively, it can also be calculated as,

$$
R^2 = \frac{\sum(\hat{y}_{t} - \bar{y})^2}{\sum(y_{t}-\bar{y})^2},
$$

where the summations are over all observations. Thus, it reflects the proportion of variation in the forecast variable that is accounted for (or explained) by the regression model.

In simple linear regression, the value of $R^2$ is also equal to the square of the correlation between $y$ and $x$ (provided an intercept has been included).

If the predictions are close to the actual values, we would expect $R^2$ to be close to 1. On the other hand, if the predictions are unrelated to the actual values, then $R^2=0$ (again, assuming there is an intercept). In all cases, $R^2$ lies between 0 and 1.

The $R^2$ value is used frequently, though often incorrectly, in forecasting. The value of $R^2$ will never decrease when adding an extra predictor to the model and this can lead to over-fitting. There are no set rules for what is a good $R^2$ value, and typical values of $R^2$ depend on the type of data used. Validating a model’s forecasting performance on the test data is much better than measuring the $R^2$ value on the training data.

## Example: US consumption expenditure

Figure 7.7 plots the actual consumption expenditure values versus the fitted values. The correlation between these variables is $r=0.877$ hence $R^2=0.768$ (shown in the output above). In this case, the model does an excellent job as it explains 76.8% of the variation in the consumption data. Compare that to the $R^2$ value of 0.15 obtained from the simple regression with the same data set in Section 7.1. **Adding the three extra predictors has allowed a lot more of the variation in the consumption data to be explained.**

## Standard error of the regression

Another measure of how well the model has fitted the data is the standard deviation of the residuals, which is often known as the “residual standard error”. This is shown in the above output with the value 0.31.

It is calculated

$$
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\sigma}_e=\sqrt{\frac{1}{T-k-1}\sum_{t=1}^{T}{e_t^2}},
  \tag{7.3}
\end{equation}
$$

where $k$ is the number of predictors in the model. Notice that we divide by $T−k−1$ because we have estimated $k+1$ parameters (the intercept and a coefficient for each predictor variable) in computing the residuals.

The standard error is related to the size of the average error that the model produces. We can compare this error to the sample mean of $y$ or with the standard deviation of $y$ to gain some perspective on the accuracy of the model.

The standard error will be used when generating prediction intervals, discussed in Section 7.6.
