We generally consider three types of patterns in time series:

- trend
- seasonality
- cycles

trend and cycle are usually combined into a single trend-cycle component often just called trend.

A time series can then be decomposed into:

- trend component
- seasonality component of which there may be multiple
- remainder component

# 3.1 Transformations and Adjustments

When decomposing a time series, it is sometimes helpful to first transform or adjust the series in order to make the decomposition (and later analysis) as simple as possible. So we will begin by discussing transformations and adjustments.

## Calendar adjustments

Use average/month rather than raw totals

## Population adjustments

Convert to per capita data where appropriate.

```{r}
global_economy |>
  filter(Country == "Australia") |>
  autoplot(GDP/Population) +
  labs(title = "GDP per capita", y = "$US")
```

## Inflation adjustments

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) can be used to adjust current values for inflation based on a prior time. The price index $z_t$ and the original hose price in year $t$ as $y_t$ can be used to calculated the adjusted value by $x_t=t_t/z_t*z_{2000}$ which would give the adjusted price based on year 2000 dollar values.

As an example, we can look at the annual newspaper and book sales in `aus_retail` and adjust the data for inflation using CPI from `global_economy`


```{r}
print_retail <- aus_retail |>
  filter(Industry == "Newspaper and book retailing") |>
  group_by(Industry) |>
  index_by(Year = year(Month)) |>
  summarise(Turnover = sum(Turnover))
aus_economy <- global_economy |>
  filter(Code == "AUS")
```

```{r}
print_retail |>
  left_join(aus_economy, by = "Year") |>
  mutate(Adjusted_turnover = Turnover / CPI * 100) |>
  pivot_longer(c(Turnover, Adjusted_turnover),
               values_to = "Turnover") |>
  mutate(name = factor(name,
         levels=c("Turnover","Adjusted_turnover"))) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = Turnover)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(name ~ ., scales = "free_y") +
  labs(title = "Turnover: Australian print media industry",
       y = "$AU")
```

By adjusting for inflation we see that the industry is in steeper decline than the raw data suggests.

## Mathematical transformations

**Logarithmic transformations** $w_t=\log({y_t})$, are useful when variation increases and decreases with the level of the series.

**Power transformations** $w_t=y_t^p$ are also used but are more difficult to interpret.

**Box-Cox transformations**

$$
\begin{equation}
  w_t  =
    \begin{cases}
      \log(y_t) & \text{if $\lambda=0$};  \\
      (\text{sign}(y_t)|y_t|^\lambda-1)/\lambda & \text{otherwise}.
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
$$

In the modified Box-Cox used here negative values of $y_t$ are allowed as long as $\lambda>0$ 

The logarithm used is $ln$.

$\lambda$ should be chosen to make the seasonal variation relatively constant accross the series.

`gerrero` can be used to determine $\lambda$.

```{r}
lambda <- aus_production |>
  features(Gas, features = guerrero) |>
  pull(lambda_guerrero)
lambda
```
```{r}
# install.packages("latex2exp")
aus_production |>
  autoplot(box_cox(Gas, lambda)) +
  labs(y = "",
       title = latex2exp::TeX(paste0(
         "Transformed gas production with $\\lambda$ = ",
         round(lambda,2)
       )))
```

# 3.2 Time series components

- Additive decomposition

Most appropriate if the magnitude of the seasonal fluctuations, or the variation around the trend-cycle, does not vary with the level of the time series.

$$
y_{t} = S_{t} + T_{t} + R_t
$$

where $y_t$ is the data, $S_t$ is the seasonal component, $T_t$ is the trend-cycle component and $R_t$ is the remainder component all at period $t$.

- Multiplicative decomposition

Appropriate whenthe variation in the seasonal pattern, or the variation around the trend-cycle, appears to be proportional to the level of the time series. This is common with economic time series.

$$
y_{t} = S_{t} \times T_{t} \times R_t
$$

Alternatively `log()` can first be used to stabilize the variation over time and then the additive decomposition can be used to calculate the multiplicative decomposition since 

$$
y_{t} = S_{t} \times T_{t} \times R_t \quad\text{is equivalent to}\quad
  \log y_{t} = \log S_{t} + \log T_{t} + \log R_t
$$

## Example: Employment in the US retail sector

```{r}
us_retail_employment <- us_employment |>
  filter(year(Month) >= 1990, Title == "Retail Trade") |>
  select(-Series_ID)
us_retail_employment
```
```{r}
autoplot(us_retail_employment, Employed) +
  labs(y = "Persons (thousands)",
       title = "Total employment in US retail")
```

We can decompose this with the **STL** method discussed later.

```{r}
dcmp <- us_retail_employment |>
  model(stl = STL(Employed))
components(dcmp)
```

This output forms a "dabble" or decomposition table. 

```{r}
components(dcmp) |>
  as_tsibble() |>
  autoplot(Employed, colour = "gray") +
  geom_line(aes(y = trend), colour = "#D55E00") +
  labs(
    y = "Persons (thousands)",
    title = "Total employment in US retail"
  )
```

```{r}
components(dcmp) |> autoplot()
```

The gray bars on the left indicate the relative scale of each graph.

## Seasonally adjusted data

Seasonally adjusted data is what's left after removing the seasonal component from the data, either by subraction or division.

```{r}
components(dcmp) |>
  as_tsibble() |>
  autoplot(Employed, colour = "gray") +
  geom_line(aes(y=season_adjust), colour = "#0072B2") +
  labs(y = "Persons (thousands)",
       title = "Total employment in US retail")
```

Seasonally adjusted data is useful for unemployment data, for example, because it's the non-seasonal aspects which are usually more interesting.

Remember that seasonally adjusted components still contain the trend and remainder.

# 3.3 Moving Averages

Classical decomposition method originating in the 1920s and widely used until the 1950s. It remains the basis of many time series decomposition methods.

The first step is to use a moving average method to estimate the trend-cycle.

## Moving average smoothing

A moving average of order $m$ can be written:

$$
\begin{equation}
  \hat{T}_{t} = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{j=-k}^k y_{t+j}
\end{equation}
$$

where $m=2k+1$. This eliminates some of the randomness and smooths the trend-cycle component. This is called an $m$**-MA**, meaning a moving average of order $m$.

```{r}
global_economy |>
  filter(Country == "Australia") |>
  autoplot(Exports) +
  labs(y = "% of GDP", title = "Total Australian Exports")
```

```{r}
aus_exports <- global_economy |>
  filter(Country == "Australia") |>
  mutate(
    `5-MA` = slider::slide_dbl(Exports, mean,
                .before = 2, .after = 2, .complete = TRUE)
  )
aus_exports
```

```{r}
aus_exports |>
  autoplot(Exports) +
  geom_line(aes(y = `5-MA`), colour = "#D55E00") +
  labs(y = "% of GDP",
       title = "Total Australian exports") +
  guides(colour = guide_legend(title = "series"))
```

The moving average is smoother than the original data. The larger the order the smoother the line.

<img src="https://otexts.com/fpp3/fpp_files/figure-html/aus-exports-compare-1.png" />

Note that the order is usually odd so that the moving objects averages are symmetric.

## Moving averages of moving averages

For even-ordered moving average we can take a moving average of the moving averages to make them symmetrical.

```{r}
beer <- aus_production |>
  filter(year(Quarter) >= 1992) |>
  select(Quarter, Beer)
beer_ma <- beer |>
  mutate(
    `4-MA` = slider::slide_dbl(Beer, mean,
                .before = 1, .after = 2, .complete = TRUE),
    `2x4-MA` = slider::slide_dbl(`4-MA`, mean,
                .before = 1, .after = 0, .complete = TRUE)
  )
beer_ma
```

When a 2-MA follows a moving average of an even order (such as 4), it is called a “centred moving average of order 4”. This is because the results are now symmetric. To see that this is the case, we can write the $2 \times 4$-MA as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
  \hat{T}_{t} &= \frac{1}{2}\Big[
    \frac{1}{4} (y_{t-2}+y_{t-1}+y_{t}+y_{t+1}) +
    \frac{1}{4} (y_{t-1}+y_{t}+y_{t+1}+y_{t+2})\Big] \\
             &= \frac{1}{8}y_{t-2}+\frac14y_{t-1} +
             \frac14y_{t}+\frac14y_{t+1}+\frac18y_{t+2}.
\end{align*}
$$
Other combinations are commonly used such as $3 \times 3$-MA.

## Estimating the trend-cycle with seasonal data

Centered moving averages are most commonly used for extracting the trend-cycle from seaonal data. For the $2 \times 4$-MA:

$$
\hat{T}_{t} = \frac{1}{8}y_{t-2} + \frac14y_{t-1} +
    \frac14y_{t} + \frac14y_{t+1} + \frac18y_{t+2}
$$

In general a $2 \times m$-MA is equvalent to a weighted moving average of order $m+1$ where all observations take the weight $1/m$ except the first and last which take weights of $1/2m$. For example, a $2 \times 12$-MA can be used to estimate the trend-cycle of monthly data with annual seasonality and a $7$-MA can estimate the trend-cycle of daily data with weekly seasonality.

## Example: Employment in the US retail sector

```{r}
us_retail_employment_ma <- us_retail_employment |>
  mutate(
    `12-MA` = slider::slide_dbl(Employed, mean,
                .before = 5, .after = 6, .complete = TRUE),
    `2x12-MA` = slider::slide_dbl(`12-MA`, mean,
                .before = 1, .after = 0, .complete = TRUE)
  )
us_retail_employment_ma |>
  autoplot(Employed, colour = "gray") +
  geom_line(aes(y = `2x12-MA`), colour = "#D55E00") +
  labs(y = "Persons (thousands)",
       title = "Total employment in US retail")
```

This is much like the trend-cycle obtained earlier with more sophisticated methods.

## Weighted moving averages

$$
\hat{T}_t = \sum_{j=-k}^k a_j y_{t+j}
$$

where $k=(m-1)/2$ and the weights are given by $[a_{-k},\dots,a_k]$ and the **weights must sum to one** and that they are symmetric.

# Classical decomposition

## Additive decomposition

1. Compute the trend-cycle component $\hat{T}_t$ using a $2\times m$-MA if $m$ is even and $m$-MA if $m$ is odd.

2. Calculate the De-trended Series: $y_t-T_t$

3. Estimate seasonal component $\hat{S}_t$. To estimate the seasonal component for each season, simply average the detrended values for that season. For example, with monthly data, the seasonal component for March is the average of all the detrended March values in the data. These seasonal component values are then adjusted to ensure that they add to zero. The seasonal component is obtained by stringing together these monthly values, and then replicating the sequence for each year of data. 

4. Remainder: $\hat{R}_t=y_t-\hat{T}_t-\hat{S}_t$

```{r}
us_retail_employment |>
  model(
    classical_decomposition(Employed, type = "additive")
  ) |>
  components() |>
  autoplot() +
  labs(title = "Classical additive decomposition of total US retail employment")
```


## Multiplicative decomposition

Similar to additive.

1. Estimate Trend: $\hat{T}_t$

2. Calculate the De-trended Series: $y_t/\hat{T}_t$

3. Estimate Seasonal Components: $\hat{S}_t$

4. Remainder $\hat{R}_t=y_t/(\hat{T}_t\hat{S}_t)$

```{r}
us_retail_employment |>
  model(
    classical_decomposition(Employed, type = "multiplicative")
  ) |>
  components() |>
  autoplot() +
  labs(title = "Classical multiplicative decomposition of total US retail employment")
```

## Comments on classical decomposition

While classical decomposition is still widely used, it is not recommended, as there are now several much better methods. Some of the problems with classical decomposition are summarized below.

- The estimate of the trend-cycle is unavailable for the first few and last few observations. For example, if $m=12$, there is no trend-cycle estimate for the first six or the last six observations. Consequently, there is also no estimate of the remainder component for the same time periods.

- The trend-cycle estimate tends to over-smooth rapid rises and falls in the data.

- Classical decomposition methods assume that the seasonal component repeats from year to year. For many series, this is a reasonable assumption, but for some longer series it is not. For example, electricity demand patterns have changed over time as air conditioning has become more widespread. In many locations, the seasonal usage pattern from several decades ago had its maximum demand in winter (due to heating), while the current seasonal pattern has its maximum demand in summer (due to air conditioning). Classical decomposition methods are unable to capture these seasonal changes over time.

- Occasionally, the values of the time series in a small number of periods may be particularly unusual. For example, the monthly air passenger traffic may be affected by an industrial dispute, making the traffic during the dispute different from usual. The classical method is not robust to these kinds of unusual values.

# 3.5 Methods used by official statistics agencies

Most use variants of the X-11 method, the SEATS method or a combination of the two. They are specifically designed for **quarterly and monthly** data. They will not handle other types of seasonality such as weekly, daily or hourly. The latest implementation is **X-13ARIMA-SEATS** availbel in the `seasonal` package.

```{r}
library(seasonal)
```
## X-11 method

```{r}
x11_dcmp <- us_retail_employment |>
  model(x11 = X_13ARIMA_SEATS(Employed ~ x11())) |>
  components()
autoplot(x11_dcmp) +
  labs(title = "Decomposition of total US retail employment using X-11")
```

Compare this decomposition with the STL decomposition and the classical decomposition shown above. The default approach for X_13ARIMA_SEATS shown here is a multiplicative decomposition, whereas the STL and classical decompositions shown earlier were additive; but it doesn’t make much difference in this case. The X-11 trend-cycle has captured the sudden fall in the data due to the 2007–2008 global financial crisis better than either of the other two methods (where the effect of the crisis has leaked into the remainder component). Also, the unusual observation in 1996 is now more clearly seen in the X-11 remainder component.

```{r}
x11_dcmp |>
  ggplot(aes(x = Month)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = Employed, colour = "Data")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = season_adjust,
                colour = "Seasonally Adjusted")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = trend, colour = "Trend")) +
  labs(y = "Persons (thousands)",
       title = "Total employment in US retail") +
  scale_colour_manual(
    values = c("gray", "#0072B2", "#D55E00"),
    breaks = c("Data", "Seasonally Adjusted", "Trend")
  )
```

A seasonal sub-series plot of the seasonal component can help visualize the variation over time.

```{r}
x11_dcmp |>
  gg_subseries(seasonal)
```

## SEATS method

"Seasonal Extraction in ARIMA Time Series" is a method developed by the Bank of Spain and is now used in government agencies world-wide. 

```{r}
seats_dump <- us_retail_employment |>
  model(seats = X_13ARIMA_SEATS(Employed ~ seats())) |>
  components()
autoplot(seats_dump) +
  labs(title = "Decomposition of total US retail employment using SEATS")
```

This gives similar results to the X-11 method.

# 3.6 STL decomposition

- Handles any type of seasonality, not just monthly and quarterly
- The seasonal component can vary over time with a rate of change controlled by the user
- The smoothness of the trend cycle can be controlled by the user
- It can be robust to outliers, although they will affect the remainder
- Does not handle calendar variation automatically
- Only provides facilities for additive decompositions

A multiplicative decomposition can be obtained by first taking logs of the data, then back-transforming the components. Decompositions that are between additive and multiplicative can be obtained using a Box-Cox transformation of the data with $0<\lambda<1$. A value of $\lambda=0$ gives a multiplicative decomposition while $\lambda=1$ gives an additive decomposition.

```{r}
us_retail_employment |>
  model(
    STL(Employed ~ trend(window = 7) +
          season(window = "periodic"),
        robust = TRUE)) |>
  components() |>
  autoplot()
```

The two main parameters to be chosen when using STL are the trend-cycle window `trend(window = ?)` and the seasonal window `season(window = ?)`. These control how rapidly the trend-cycle and seasonal components can change. Smaller values allow for more rapid changes. Both trend and seasonal windows should be odd numbers; trend window is the number of consecutive observations to be used when estimating the trend-cycle; season window is the number of consecutive years to be used in estimating each value in the seasonal component. Setting the seasonal window to be infinite is equivalent to forcing the seasonal component to be periodic season(window='periodic') (i.e., identical across years).

By default, `STL()` provides a convenient automated STL decomposition using a seasonal window of `season(window=13)`, and the trend window chosen automatically from the seasonal period. The default setting for monthly data is `trend(window=21)`. This usually gives a good balance between over-fitting the seasonality and allowing it to slowly change over time. But, as with any automated procedure, the default settings will need adjusting for some time series. In this case the default trend window setting produces a trend-cycle component that is too rigid. As a result, signal from the 2008 global financial crisis has leaked into the remainder component, as can be seen in the bottom panel of Figure 3.7. Selecting a shorter trend window as in Figure 3.18 improves this
